Observations
Epochs: 500 epochs might be excessive for this task, especially with a small dataset or frozen base model. Consider early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Test Data: The test set only has two samples (Person_08/rec_2 and Person_02/rec_1). This is too small for robust evaluationâ€”metrics like EER and ROC may not generalize well.

Normalization: You normalize X_train and X_test separately. Ideally, use the same min/max values (e.g., from training data) for consistency.

Data Balance: If most records are imposters (0s), the dataset might be imbalanced, skewing the baseline accuracy and model performance.
